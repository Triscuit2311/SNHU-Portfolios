## Q&A 
# 
## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
> To ensure functional and secure code, I can try prioritize software design that integrates testing. This includes test-driven development and working towards full test coverage. Since the software design is based around the tests, it inherently meets design requirments. Additionally, using automation tools and dependency checks, I can eleminate well-known vulnerabilities and ensure that code changes do not break features.
#
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
> To incorporate user needs into a program, my first step is to lay out requirements that meet their needs. Once the requirements for the system and design are well defined, designing the program structure becomes much easier. The design stage should try to account for the entire system and it's interoperability, and the requirements can be developed into tests. Once the tests and structure are defined, we can begin development on the actual program code.
#
## How do I approach designing software?
> The design process I try to follow involves understanding the problem, identifying requirements, and creating an architecture that can handle changes. The most important element of design I have learned working on the assignments in this course is to break down the requirements into manageable tasks and plan ahead. After this, designing the implementation is much easier. I could stand to focus on simplicity and maintainability throughout development in the future, as sometimes I tend to over-complicate things.
