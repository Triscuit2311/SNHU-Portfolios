# CS230-GamingRoomDesign
A design document for CS230.

## Reflection
### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a small game company that created a mobile game in the style of a vintage game show. The company is looking to expand their game to a larger user base across multiple platforms. 
		
### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I provided a thorough platform evaluation which addresses development and deployment on various platforms. This evaluation included both client and server application (Client being mid-teir as I chose a web application approach). This provided an excellent set of data when making my recommendations.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Understanding the target architecture and design patterns was integral to development of the application. Additionally, the completed UML documents serve as a framework for the structure of the application.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the design constraints. As we have learned more about various platforms and security, I think I could refine and better express the constraints I identified early on.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs define the basis for the application goals. In the case of *The Gaming Room*,  they were looking to scale up while maintaining a somewhat tight budget. This created a constraint of development, we chose to go with a web application to meet this need. Had we chose a different path, like a specialized native application for each individual target platform, we would have far exceeded the budget and the goals of the client. 

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach started with a rough white-boarding of the overall application. I used the UML diagrams and design constraints to choose the correct platform and structure. In the future I would look for more information from the client regarding their capabilities and specific needs.
