## Q&A 

### How do I approach designing software? 

> My design process involves understanding the problem, identifying requirements, and creating an architecture that can handle changes. The most important element of design I have learned working on the CS330 projects is to break down the requirements into manageable tasks and plan ahead. After this, designing the implementation is much easier. I could stand to focus on simplicity and maintainability throughout development in the future, as sometimes I tend to over-complicate things.

### How do I approach developing programs? 

> I have been working to approach program development through iterative refinement. The projects I have worked on throughout this class have had variying levels of requirements, where often an assignment needs specific technical erquirements, but grats me creative freedom in my appraoch. I also have been trying to prioritize my personal growth by applying modern programming practices and pushing myself to keep my work clean and maintainable. Not only has this paid off in writing programs that meet and exceed the requirements, but it has forced me to learn quite a bit more than if I were just shooting for the bare minimum.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

> Computer science skills, including the C++ and computer graphics programming that I have worked to develop throughout this course, can help me achieve my career goals in software engineering. Having foundations in object-oriented programming and understanding design patterns in low-level languages are absolute requirements when developing high performance applications, working with real time graphics, and in game engine development. Additionally, problem-solving is applicable everywhere, regardless of the industry or specialization.
