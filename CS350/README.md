## Q&A (TODO)


### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of this poject was to develop a rudimentry thermostat; the problem was that there needs to be a way to control the climate control of a room.

### What did you do particularly well?
The task scheduling system is probably the best code I wrote here, it is very simple and effective.

### Where could you improve?
Since the scope of this project was limited to a single file, my code organization suffered. I would have liked some level of encapsulation, or at least a structure to hold program settings.

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I certainly won't be adding Texas Instruments' IDE (Code Composer Studio), anything based on Eclipse doesn't really have a place in my toolbox. However, I have been inspired to do more work on my embedded projects, and I've found a few useful resources during this project (technical documentation) that I have kept for future use.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Hardware debugging. This is a skill I have somewhat limited experience with; I have worked mainly with ARM Cortex-M0+ architectures, and the chance to work with ARM Cortex-M4 is great. I plan to setup j-link for this board in the future.

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept it simple and wrote meaningful code comments where nessesary. I am a proprietor of not over-documenting, and I think this is a good example of that. Unlike some projects (like the SLACCr API), there was not much code documentation needed here, concise naming convetions helped a lot.
