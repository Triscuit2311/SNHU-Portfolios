## Q&A (TODO)


### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The starter code for this project consisted of; the game setup code (generating the maze), the model setup code including experience caching, and the framework to build our Q-learning functionality (utilities, etc). I build the Q-Learning functionality, as well as modified some of the starter code to perform better. Namely I removed the static epsilon and built a decay system, increased the amount of memory allocated for episodes, and increased the maximum data size for training. 

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**  
Computer scientists are responsible for progressing technology, from hardware manufacturing research to reverse engineering. Performing research and development, discovering new ways to approach problems, and making technology smaller and faster are just a few highlights of what computer scientists are responsible for.  These things grow the field, but also push us as a species forward into the future.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  
I approach problems with a pseudo-scientific method. I state the problem and lay out an approach to solve it, try it and test it, and record the results.


**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**  
My main ethical concern is always going to be personal privacy. Loyalty to an organization is important, but never comes before loyalty to my personal morals. I feel that it is my duty to protect the users' and organization's data.
