    "The theme of this project is a popular treasure hunt game in which the player needs to find the treasure before the pirate does. While you will not be developing the entire game, you will write the part of the game that represents the intelligent agent, which is a pirate in this case. The pirate will try to find the optimal path to the treasure using deep Q-learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with two Python classes and this notebook to help you with this assignment. The first class, TreasureMaze.py, represents the environment, which includes a maze object defined as a matrix. The second class, GameExperience.py, stores the episodes â€“ that is, all the states that come in between the initial state and the terminal state. This is later used by the agent for learning by experience, called \"exploration\". This notebook shows how to play a game. Your task is to complete the deep Q-learning implementation for which a skeleton implementation has been provided. The code blocks you will need to complete has #TODO as a header.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, read and review the next few code and instruction blocks to understand the code that you have been given."
