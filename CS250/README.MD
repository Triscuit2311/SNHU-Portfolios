## Q & A

#### **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
  Interpreting and implementing user needs is a core aspect of program design. It really should start by listening to and understanding (or finding someone who does) the actual intentions of the software. Having a subject matter expert would be very helpful when designing software for a field you're unfamiliar with. For example if you are tasked to design software for calculating metric for rockets sent to space, you can't expect every software developer to be a rocket scientist also. You need some type of middle-man so to speak. User Stories are essential to this process, as they typically represent real-workd actions the program must perform, but translated into context for the development team.


#### **How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  Most of the work I have done thus far has been independant, though I have been trying to design my software intelligently. Since in most cases (besides a couple of my 'more popular' repos) I am the sole client, and I play all roles on the development team myself. These days I always start with a minimum of a flow-chart and some whiteboarding. Thoughout development I really do love to use my whiteboard to keep organized. In the future I would love to work in a more test-driven workflow; and break my tasks down even smaller.

#### **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  This is a big question. In terms of being an Agile team member, I think taking responsibility is key. Working together can be difficult at times, but teams who trust eachother and are open always suceed more than those who do not. Holding your peers accountable is one of the toughest things to do, but if everyone is willing to admit their mistakes and take responsibility; it gets much easier. I do not have any experience on a software development team, but I have extensive experience leading and being a member of other teams, at the end of the day it's about comraderie, it's about being in it together.
