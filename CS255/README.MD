## Q&A 


### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass, a driver training company. They're looking to provide accessible training for potential new drivers to help prepare people for their DMV driving exam and practical tests. They want an online learning management system to accomplish this.

### What did you do particularly well?

I think my strongest aspect of this project was the UML activity diagrams. I worked hard to make them coherent and easy to follow while still maintaining good technical detail.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would put more time into my presentation notes, though I do feel that I communicated effectively the system design goals, but I think I could have elaborated in certain places.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are the foundation for the system's design requirements. In this type of design considering the user's experience and ability to accomplish what they intent to is extremely important. Using these requirements as a guide to system design allows us to design a system that not only empowers the user to do what they want to do, but provides an experience that is free of bloat.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach is based on my own experiences as the principals I've learned throughout my education thus far. I often view requirements as tests and even work to develop 'tests' to ensure my design meets the requirements I've set out to meet. I have an easier time reading and understanding code and technical documentation than I do theory, so using technical UML diagrams is a huge asset for me.
