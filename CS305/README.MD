## Q&A 

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client is Artemis financial, a financial management company. They're looking to provide better security for their finanial management web application.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think I provided well-documented and clean code that is free of code errors. I also worked hard to provide an optimal and modern solution to the encryption implementation.

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Learning how to work with vulnerability and dependency reports was a great experience, and I'll certainly be using this approach in the future, if I'm working with Java.


### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I added layers of security by implementing encryption, as well as using modern programming principals and creating modular components. Additionally, appropriate error handling is a layer of security itself. Using the dependency check is great for checking documented vulnerabilities, but having a team member or pair programming would be an effective checking method as well.


### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure?

After making changes, I ensured the program compiled without warnings and ran as expected. I also re-ran the dependency check to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Penetrating testing for red-teaming would be an effective additional method here, and would help test the code against non-documented vulnerabilities as well.

### After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Using the dependency check as well as actually compiling and running the code, as mentioned above.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I implemented some common object oriented programming principals (such as encapsulation) which keeps the code base inherently more secure and easy to work with. I also kept very documentation up-to-date as I worked.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I am proud of my work revising and refactoring the code base for this assignment, so I would not hesitate to show a potential fucture employer my work implementing the encryption algorithm.
