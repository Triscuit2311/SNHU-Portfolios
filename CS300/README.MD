## Q&A

### **What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The problem I was working to solve during this course was that the client (ABCU) needed orginizational software for their course management.

### **How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
By utilizing different data structures, we can better organize the course data. Different data structures lend themselves to access and sorting via different algorithms. Understanding the pros and cons of data structures allows us to choose the best option for each scenario.

### **How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
While working on developing this project, I was learning more and more complex (and optimized) concepts. This meant that as I worked, my code became outdated quickly. I often would finish an aspect of my design and realize that I could do it better. I spent a lot of time coding alomng with the coursework this term, which helped me to better understand the concepts behind some of the data structures.

### **How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
I put a lot more thought and research into what type of data structure is best suited for specific tasks. Now, while designing an application, I can better base the interactions of objects on what algorithms might perform the best.

### **How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I wrote a lot of documentation thoughout this course, more than I really have before. This alone has made my personal projects feel like they are lacking; I've even gone back and added more documentation to a number of my pre-existing projects. In addition, I have reallyed started using flowcharts in my own projects, a skill that I have been working to develop though this course.

Thanks for all your help this term!
